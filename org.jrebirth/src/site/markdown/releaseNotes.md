Release Notes
==============

0.7.5 - Keep On Move Release - 2013-09-30
-----------------------------------------

This version provides several priceless enhancements, you should consider migration.

- Force callCommand to use right WaveBean class feature  
Now the callCommand require to use the right WaveBean type according to the command class used


- Allow to catch orphan waves feature &amp; Improve WaveBean usability duplicate  
Orphan waves will be caught by an handler that could be parameterized, the default one will throw a RuntimeException only if DeveloperMode is activated  


- Manage default services feature
The service component has now a fully operational service task used to follow progression with binding.  
A bug was also fixed that was leading to a pause into the JIT waiting the result of the service. Now services are fully parallelized (running into JTP) and don't block the JIT.  
Thanks to Antoine for having disclosed [this problem](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jrebirth-users/pFp4HcGzvpI/4RPI3ZXNiLUJ "Antoine's explanation") (related to dead code).  


- Add resource parameter support  
All resources can be parameterized into JRebirth properties files.


- Provide Undo/Redo support
An Undo/Redo module has been added to demonstrate that Command layer is versatile and can manage complex workflow.  
A Showcase has been also added and deployed on the website: [Undo/Redo Showcase](showcases/UndoRedo.html "UndoRedo Showcase").   
Thanks to Bastien for [bug fix](https://github.com/JRebirth/JRebirth/pull/65 "Bastien's Pull Request").


- Allow Wave filtering according to a filter Data
When a component listen a generic wave, it will receive all waves even those related to other components.  
Now it's possible add a filter (defined as a callback) to receive only right waves.  
A sample is available into the StackModel component (of components module).


- Allow customization of component instantiation
It's now possible to define its own factory class in order to build JRebirth top-level components (Command, Service, Model).  
For example you can plug a injector (like Guice) into your factory to build a outstanding pluggable software.  


- Bad Wave Contract Check with several parameters  
When application is start with developerMode parameter to true, all wave handler method are checked at runtime, this feature is now fully operational


- Boolean Property is not overridable bug fix  
The default value of some parameters couldn't be updated by properties file, it's fixed


- Override programmatically a Parameter  
It's now possible to override programmatically a parameter by calling the define method, parameters values will be set according to this order : default, properties file, define call.
